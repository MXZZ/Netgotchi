# üõ°Ô∏è Netgotchi - ESP32-C6 + ST7789 1.47" LCD Fork

![Netgotchi Image](https://github.com/MXZZ/Netgotchi/assets/3322271/947416e6-c088-4167-ba62-e69a6d1170ce)

> Netgotchi: Your network's loyal guardian! üêæ

This is a **community fork** of the original Netgotchi project, specifically adapted for **Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47"** with **ST7789 display (172√ó320)** using Arduino IDE.

A small arduino .ino script with some great functions to detect intruders or breaches in the network, it pings periodically the network and reports if any new device. It also has a rudimental "Honeypot" functionality with a rudimental exposed service, once someone reaches the honeypot it will trigger an alarm. Please contribute to the repository via pull requests!

Tested with Nmap, service scan / intense scan will trigger the alert.

botton left corner : how many devices are active in the wifi network  
bottom center : number of VU ( vulnerabilities ) found  
bottom right corner : status - idle /scan  
center : netgotchi face and animations, the netgotchi will start crying ( T_T ) if there was an attack and it will display the attacker ip address. Netgotchi will display an "evil twin face" if someone cloned your wifi for an evil attack "( e_t )".  

- 2nd Page : 
active devices - UP for recently active, DOWN recently disconnected , WNR warning if they have a vulnerability

- 3rd Page : 
Network speed and network integrity ( ping, average speed, connection status )

- 4th Page :
Netgotchi IP and uptime 

- Extra:
Pro only : move page and setting menu on left button / right button  
V2 and Pro only : audio alarm on attack  
 
## üîß Troubleshooting (ESP32-C6 Fork)

### Common Issues
- **ESP-NOW compilation errors**: Ensure all `.ino` files include `globals.h` at the top
- **Missing `minTime()/maxTime()` functions**: Install ESP32Ping library or use only `averageTime()`
- **Display shows nothing**: Check wiring connections and ensure ST7789 library is installed
- **SD_MMC errors**: FTP is disabled in this fork, these errors shouldn't occur
- **WebUI matrix appears empty**: This is normal on ST7789 (no framebuffer for 128√ó64 matrix view)

### Legal Notice
**Deauther functions are disabled on ESP32-C6** and may be illegal in many countries. This fork focuses on network monitoring only.
