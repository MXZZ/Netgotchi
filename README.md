> Netgotchi: Your network's loyal guardian! üêæ

A small arduino .ino script with some great functions to detect intruders or breaches in the network, it pings periodically the network and reports if any new device. It also has a rudimental "Honeypot" functionality with a rudimental exposed service, once someone reaches the honeypot it will trigger an alarm. Please contribute to the repository via pull requests!

Tested with Nmap, service scan / intense scan will trigger the alert.

## üìö Libraries

- ESP8266/ESP32 core libraries
- Modified FTP Server library (ESP8266FtpServer or ESP32FtpServer) -- you need to install the one provided in the "/libraries" folder in this repo
- Adafruit_GFX
- Adafruit_SSD1306, Adafruit_SH110X, or Adafruit_SSD1305 (based on your OLED type)
- ESPping
- NTPClient
- WiFiManager
- Button2

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE, make sure you have all files open like the image below :
   ![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/552f5d19-d55d-4d47-9ef4-f200438421e6)

2. Select your OLED display type by setting the appropriate flag to 1 (e.g., `#define oled_type_ssd1306 1`).![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1fef59b-e22a-4555-94cb-8ef26b71e756)

3. Install the required libraries via the Arduino Library Manager.
4. Select your board (ESP8266 or ESP32) in the Arduino IDE.
5. Flash the code to your board.
6. On the first boot, Netgotchi will create a WiFi hotspot named "AutoConnectAP" for you to set up your WiFi credentials.
7. Once connected, Netgotchi will start guarding your network!
